this project is propposed as the graduation project for the embedded systems course given by AMIT, the idea of this project is to build an internal system for an 
electrical water heater with two main functions:
    1. increase temperature 
    2. decrease temperature
& a side function of displaying the current water temperature on a seven segment display.
there are three buttons {on/off, temp_up, temp_down} used to power the device, increase/decrease temperature. for this project we used Proteus to implement the 
componnents that we couldn't put our hands on & the connections can be found in [here](https://github.com/abdotamer/ElectricHeaterProject/blob/main/Circuit%20on%20Proteus.jpg)
